# Big-Data-Tools-HDFS-and-Hive-SQL
This repository contains my work in the field of big data science. 

I worked on the clusters of Queens University and University of Toronto. I also worked with DataBricks during the same time. Mainly my work was focused on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and Hive SQL. I also started exploring at PySpark and Scala.

There are two PDFs and two CSV files in the repository. The description is given below:

1) [HDFS_Commands_Theory.pdf](https://github.com/trived76/Big-Data-Tools-HDFS-and-Hive-SQL/blob/master/HDFS_Commands_Theory.pdf):
This file contains various questions and answers on HDFS. This is a gentle introduction into the big data file system. 

2) [HiveSQL_Queries.pdf](https://github.com/trived76/Big-Data-Tools-HDFS-and-Hive-SQL/blob/master/HiveSQL_Queries.pdf):
The file contains various queries written in Hive SQL sytax. This was for the first time I was writing the SQL queries! Mainly, you will find the use of aggregation functions (avergage and sum), group by, sort by, joins, where syntax, sub-query and concatenation.

For queries, two CSV files: [game.csv](https://github.com/trived76/Big-Data-Tools-HDFS-and-Hive-SQL/blob/master/game.csv) and [team_info.csv](https://github.com/trived76/Big-Data-Tools-HDFS-and-Hive-SQL/blob/master/team_info.csv) are used.

I wish, I could have also written queries with the having clause and window functions. Having can be used on dynamic tables, meaning aggregate functions can be followed by a having clause to select the part of the data. Where as the where clause can only be used on
